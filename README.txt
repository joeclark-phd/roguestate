PREMISE:
This is going to be a relatively simple roguelike game written in Python with Pyglet. It will incorporate some code that I wrote for earlier, unfinished games, so I can delete those old repositories.  Consider it a vanilla game that you can build on top of.


STATUS:
The game is evolving but hardly interesting yet.  There are no enemies, just a field with some walls and rooms you can walk around.  Use the arrow keys to move around.  Press TAB to get a "look/examine" cursor and see what's on each tile.  Press "I" to toggle the information panel at the right (which currently has no information in it).  Press "C" to re-center the map on the player. You can resize the window.  Press ESC for an escape menu.


DEVELOPED USING:
Python 3.4
pyglet 1.2alpha1 (included in /program/dependencies/ directory)


TO PLAY:
Run "roguestate.py".
