PREMISE:
This is going to be a relatively simple roguelike game written in Python with Pyglet. It will incorporate some code that I wrote for earlier, unfinished games, so I can delete those old repositories.  Consider it a vanilla game that you can build on top of.


USES:
Python 3.4
pyglet 1.2alpha1 (included in /program/dependencies/ directory)


TO PLAY:
Run "roguestate.py".
