# Defines "named colors" for the game (the preferred way to change color schemes). Format:
#   NAME=RRGGBB or NAME=RRGGBBAA (if you want to specify alpha; default is FF, no transparency)


########
# Default foreground, background, and transparent background colors.
# These three names (fg, bg, no_bg) are expected by the program and may be changed but not deleted.
########

    fg = ffffffff  # default foreground color
    bg = 000000ff  # default opaque background color
    no_bg = 00000000  # a transparent background




########
# User defined "named" colors. These may be used in tiles.txt to colorize tiles.
# This would allow you to change the color scheme all at once (e.g., by changing the RGBA mix for "red").
# It is not *necessary* to use a named palette, but it would be clever to do so.
